# pdbox

**No-frills CLI for Dropbox.**

## Installation

```
$ pip install pdbox
```

## Usage

```
$ pdbox put <file> [destination] [-f]
$ pdbox get <file> [destination] [-f]
```

## Access Tokens

To access Dropbox, an OAuth2 access token is required. `pdbox` will take care
of this for you, but if you already have a token and want to use it, you can
set the `PDBOX_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Motivation

> Dropbox already has a CLI, what's the point?

Installing `dropbox-cli` on Arch Linux uses 147 MB, that's a lot!  
This is not intended for "power users" looking for advanced sync
functionality and more, but rather for those looking for a quick, easy way to
access their files when the full Dropbox client isn't practical, such as
headless VMs or low-resource servers.
